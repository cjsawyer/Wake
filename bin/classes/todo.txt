Up next: dynamically generating the texture attribute arrays in game_textures.
Also, move all of those methods somewhere else.

need to go through every draw call and use the depths in game_constants

Idea to restructure textures/sounds/fonts/other assets:
	Instead of a big static array of attributes, have a array of texture/sound objects that hold one set of these attributes each.
Still use a constant to reference the position in the array. This would allow dynamic loading!
