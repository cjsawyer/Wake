///// This Commit /////

added functional post-game screen
removed drawTextSingleString, simplified drawText
deleted engine_strings, moved the StringBuilder into draw.text
switched ref.draw.X_ALIGN_LEFT and ref.draw.X_ALIGN_RIGHT. RIGHT now draws the text to the right of the X coordinate, as it should have originally. 

//////// TODO /////////

make it so mashing the back button will exit the game.
	ie make the menu AYSYQTQ dialogue exit with back button.

add high score/best streak for each difficulty in their own saves.
	Add save vars:
				EAS/MED/HIG/HEL
				*_highScore
				*_bestStreak
				*_1Hits
				*_2Hits
				*_3Hits
				*_4Hits

think of better names for g_textures and loaded_assets...
	
change sound effects
find music
make music speed scale with game speed?


switch argument order for collisionAABB, make x,y come before: x,y,w,h

Up next: dynamically generating the texture attribute arrays in game_textures.
Also, move all of those methods somewhere else.

need to go through every draw call and use the depths in game_constants

Idea to restructure textures/sounds/fonts/other assets:
	Instead of a big static array of attributes, have a array of texture/sound objects that hold one of these attributes each.
Still use a constant to reference the position in the array. This would allow dynamic loading!
