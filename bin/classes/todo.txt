///// This Commit /////

added horizontal and vertical weighting to GUI elements 
added feature so if you tap outside of the popup gui, it closes. Not sure if I like it.

//////// TODO /////////

------------
| 0 = easy |
| 1 = hard |
------------

GUI:
implement all of the functions backwards so we can wrap the content size.
add vertical weights

possibly split the build funtion into 4 functions, (wrapH, wrapV)*(weightX, weightY)

rename things so "view" replaces "component"


popup transitions
fix menu buttons


Wake ----------------------------------------

make music restart at same point when restarting app
make free users wait for the poastgame score to spin up to full, pro still has the animation, but doesn't need to wait.

Up next: dynamically generating the texture attribute arrays in game_textures.
Also, move all of those methods somewhere else.

need to go through every draw call and use the depths in game_constants

Idea to restructure textures/sounds/fonts/other assets:
	Instead of a big static array of attributes, have a array of texture/sound objects that hold one of these attributes each.
Still use a constant to reference the position in the array. This would allow dynamic loading!
